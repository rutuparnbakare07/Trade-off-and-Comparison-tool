# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A tool that enables users to systematically compare different options by analyzing their trade-offs across multiple criteria. The system helps users make informed decisions by providing structured comparison frameworks, weighted scoring, and visual representations of trade-offs.

## Glossary

- **Trade_Off_Analyzer**: The main system that facilitates comparison and analysis
- **Option**: A choice or alternative being evaluated (e.g., technology stack, business strategy, design approach)
- **Criterion**: A factor or dimension used to evaluate options (e.g., cost, performance, maintainability)
- **Weight**: The relative importance assigned to each criterion
- **Score**: A numerical rating assigned to how well an option performs on a specific criterion
- **Comparison_Matrix**: A structured representation showing all options evaluated against all criteria
- **Decision_Report**: A comprehensive analysis document showing the comparison results and recommendations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Option Management

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to define and manage multiple options for comparison, so that I can systematically evaluate different choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new comparison, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL allow them to add multiple options
2. WHEN a user adds an option, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL require a name and optional description
3. WHEN a user wants to modify an option, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL allow editing of name and description
4. WHEN a user removes an option, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL remove all associated scores and update the comparison matrix
5. THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL support at least 10 options per comparison

### Requirement 2: Criteria Definition

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to define evaluation criteria with weights, so that I can assess options based on factors important to my decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates criteria, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL require a name and allow optional description
2. WHEN a user assigns weights to criteria, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL accept values between 0 and 100
3. WHEN weights are assigned, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL normalize them to sum to 100%
4. WHEN a user removes a criterion, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL remove all associated scores and recalculate weights
5. THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL support at least 15 criteria per comparison
6. WHEN no weights are specified, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL assign equal weights to all criteria

### Requirement 3: Scoring System

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to score how well each option performs on each criterion, so that I can quantify the trade-offs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scores an option against a criterion, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL accept values on a 1-10 scale
2. WHEN a user provides a score, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL allow optional comments explaining the rating
3. WHEN scores are incomplete, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL clearly indicate which option-criterion combinations need scoring
4. WHEN all scores are provided, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL calculate weighted totals for each option
5. THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL validate that scores are within the acceptable range

### Requirement 4: Comparison Analysis

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to see calculated results and rankings, so that I can understand which options perform best overall.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all scores are provided, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL calculate a weighted total score for each option
2. WHEN calculations are complete, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL rank options from highest to lowest total score
3. WHEN displaying results, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL show both raw scores and weighted contributions
4. WHEN criteria weights change, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL recalculate all totals and rankings immediately
5. THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL identify the top-ranked option as the recommended choice

### Requirement 5: Visual Comparison

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want visual representations of the trade-offs, so that I can quickly understand the strengths and weaknesses of each option.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying comparisons, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL provide a matrix view showing all options vs all criteria
2. WHEN showing individual options, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL display radar/spider charts showing performance across criteria
3. WHEN comparing options, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL provide side-by-side bar charts for easy comparison
4. WHEN displaying results, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL use color coding to highlight high, medium, and low scores
5. THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL allow users to toggle between different visualization modes

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to save and load my comparisons, so that I can work on complex decisions over time and share them with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a comparison, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL store all options, criteria, weights, and scores
2. WHEN a user loads a comparison, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL restore the complete state including all calculations
3. WHEN saving comparisons, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL use a structured format that preserves all data
4. WHEN loading comparisons, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL validate the data format and handle errors gracefully
5. THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL support exporting comparisons to common formats (JSON, CSV)

### Requirement 7: Sensitivity Analysis

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to understand how sensitive my results are to weight changes, so that I can validate the robustness of my decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests sensitivity analysis, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL show how ranking changes with different weight distributions
2. WHEN weights are adjusted, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL immediately update rankings and highlight changes
3. WHEN performing sensitivity analysis, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL identify criteria that most strongly influence the final ranking
4. WHEN results are sensitive to weights, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL warn users about the dependency
5. THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL allow users to test "what-if" scenarios with different weight combinations

### Requirement 8: Report Generation

**User Story:** As a decision maker, I want to generate comprehensive reports, so that I can document my analysis and share findings with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL include all options, criteria, scores, and calculations
2. WHEN creating reports, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL provide executive summary with key findings and recommendations
3. WHEN reports are generated, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL include all visualizations and charts
4. WHEN exporting reports, THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL support multiple formats (PDF, HTML, Markdown)
5. THE Trade_Off_Analyzer SHALL allow customization of report content and formatting
